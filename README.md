## Example template for creating a set of slides 

This repository provides a minimal template for creating a set of slides using Quarto, RevalJS. The general instructions are located in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

Create a 1 day course on the usage of `conda` and `python`. The course material should cover an introduction and history of python, and why using it through conda is a good idea. The course should also cover how to install conda, create conda environments, and install packages using conda. The course should also cover how to use jupyter notebooks and jupyter lab.  The course should also cover how to use vscode as an IDE for python development, since this course will be accessed by students through GitHub codespaces. The course should also cover how to use pip and virtualenv as an alternative to conda. Create complete but concise slides, making sure you have at least 5 bulleted points per slide. Write code snippets where appropriate.

If you have any questions about the course, ask them before generating any content.
